"""
1. RULES (Must Follow - Otherwise Error):

    ✓ Can contain: letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_)
    ✓ Must start with: letter or underscore
    ✓ Cannot start with: digit/number
    ✓ Cannot contain: spaces or special characters (@, #, $, %, etc.)
    ✓ Cannot use: Python keywords (reserved words)

2. Valid Examples:
    name, age, first_name, _value, student1, total_marks

3. Invalid Examples:
    2name → Starts with number ✗
    first-name → Contains hyphen ✗
    first name → Contains space ✗
    @username → Contains special character ✗
    for → Python keyword ✗

4. Case Sensitivity:
    - Python treats these as DIFFERENT variables:
        name, Name, NAME, nAme
    - Be consistent with capitalization

5. Python Keywords (Cannot use as variable names):
    and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else,
    except, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, 
    lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, True, try, 
    while, with, yield

6. BEST PRACTICES (Conventions):

    ✓ Use descriptive names: age (good), a (bad)
    ✓ Use lowercase: name (good), NAME (avoid for variables)
    ✓ Use underscore for multiple words: first_name (good), firstname (okay)
    ✓ Don't use single letters except for: i, j, k (in loops)

Naming Convention: snake_case
Examples: student_name, total_marks, user_age

7. Examples of Good vs Bad Names:

    Good Names	Bad Names
    ----------  ---------
    student_age	sa
    total_price	tp
    first_name	x
    is_valid	v
    user_count	count1

name = "Pratik"
# VALID variable names
name = "John"
age = 25
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
age2 = 30
_private = "secret"
student_roll_number = 101

# INVALID variable names (These will give errors - show but don't run)
# 2age = 25           # Cannot start with number
# first-name = "John" # Cannot use hyphen
# first name = "John" # Cannot have space
# for = 5             # Cannot use Python keywords
# @name = "John"      # Cannot use special characters
